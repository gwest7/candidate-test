# candidate-test
The web challenge of a candidate's journey to greatness.

## Overview
This is an Express.js application with full TypeScript support for both server-side and client-side code. The project uses Vite for client-side bundling and hot module replacement.

## Features
- ✅ Express.js server serving static files and API routes
- ✅ Separate TypeScript configurations for server and client code
- ✅ Vite for fast client-side development and building
- ✅ Single command to start development environment
- ✅ Watch mode for both server and client TypeScript files
- ✅ Hot reloading for client-side changes
- ✅ Server restart on server-side changes

## Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Development
Start the development environment with a single command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will:
1. Start Vite in watch mode to build client-side TypeScript
2. Start the Express server with nodemon to watch server-side TypeScript
3. Both processes run concurrently and watch for file changes

The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Building for Production
Build both client and server code:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Running in Production
```bash
npm start
```

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start both client and server in development mode with watch
- `npm run dev:client` - Run only Vite build watcher for client code
- `npm run dev:server` - Run only server with nodemon
- `npm run build` - Build both client and server for production
- `npm run build:client` - Build only client code
- `npm run build:server` - Compile only server TypeScript
- `npm start` - Run the production server

## Adding Routes
To add new API routes, edit `src/server/index.ts`:

```typescript
app.get('/api/your-route', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.json({ data: 'your data' });
});
```

## Technology Stack
- **Server**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Client**: Vanilla TypeScript with Vite
- **Build Tools**: Vite (client), TypeScript Compiler (server)
- **Dev Tools**: tsx, nodemon, concurrently
